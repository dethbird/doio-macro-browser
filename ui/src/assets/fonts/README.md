Drop the TTF font file here to include it in the Vite build.

Filename: DOTMATRI.TTF

When the file is placed in this folder, `ui/src/theme.css` will reference it via `@font-face` and you can use `font-family: 'DotMatri'` in the app.

Do not commit the font if it's proprietary; if you want it tracked add it to .gitignore or store it in a separate private asset store.
